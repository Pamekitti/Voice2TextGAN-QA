How many chillers are there in this chiller plant,There are a total of 7 chillers in Chamchuri square chiller plant. 6 of which are Trane centrifugal chillers while another one is Trane VSD screw-compressor chiller
What are the cooling capacities of chillers,"There are four 1000-TR chillers, two 700-TR chillers, and one 350-RT chiller."
What is the type of water loop in CSQ chiller plant?,"In CSQ, the pump system is a primary-secondary system where primary chilled water pump (PCHP) delivers warm water into chillers and secondary chilled water pumps (SCHP) pump water across every floor of the building."
How many pumps are there?,"There are a total of 36 pumps in Chamchuri square chiller plant. 12 Each for PCHP, SCHP, and CDP respectively"
How many cooling towers are there?,"There are 4 main cooling towers that are being used during normal operation. Apart from that, there are 12 more standby cooling towers ready for emergency."
Who operates this chiller plant?,Chamchuri square chiller plant is being operated by BanpuNext-Ecoserve team with talented operators and engineers.
What is the peak building load of this site?,"Last year, the building load of CSQ chiller plant peaked on around mid of April, at 3221.8 TR so the probable peak should occur around 3000 TR"
What is the minimum building load?,"As the offices and plaza are both closed during night time, the remaining load is only residential area with the load magnitude of  around 100 TR"
The current building load is 1680 TR. Whice chillers I should operate?,"With the load of 1680 TR, it is sufficient to run 1000-TR and 700-TR for maintaining optimal cooling process."
What is the history of this chiller plant?,"Previously, the plant was divided into 2 distinct plants: one plant is used to serve cooling for plaza while another provides cooling for offices and residence. However, both plants were later merged into one single plant with added heat exchangers for transfering heat to the second chilled water loop"
Can you provide summary for CSQ chiller plant?,"The Chamchuri Square (CSQ) chiller plant is a cooling facility that is equipped with 7 chillers. 6 of which are Trane centrifugal chillers while another one is Trane VSD screw-compressor chiller. The cooling capacities of the chillers are 4 1000-TR chillers, 2 700-TR chillers, and 1 350-RT chiller. The chiller plant utilizes a primary-secondary water loop system where warm water is delivered into the chillers by primary chilled water pumps (PCHP) and cooled water is pumped across each floor of the building by secondary chilled water pumps (SCHP). The chiller plant has a total of 36 pumps, 12 for PCHP, 12 for SCHP, and 12 for CDP. 4 main cooling towers are used during normal operation and 12 standby cooling towers are ready for emergency. The chiller plant is operated by BanpuNext-Ecoserve team with talented operators and engineers. The building load of CSQ chiller plant peaked last year on around mid of April at 3221.8 TR and the minimum building load is around 100 TR during night time when offices and plaza are closed. Previously, the plant was divided into 2 distinct plants but later merged into one single plant with added heat exchangers for transfering heat to the second chilled water loop."
What sensors have already been installed in the plant?,"There are a total of 6 pairs of water temperature sensors that are linked with 6 BTU meters. Apart from that, several analog meters for measuring pressure and temperature can be found across the plant but none of them can be digitally linked to BAS."
Do you know kW/TR of each chiller?,"No, there is no flow rate sensor in front of each individual sensor thus it is not possible to exactly calculate for the exact performance of each chiller. However, it is still possible to approximate each individual chiller's efficiency by looking at %RLA or pressure drop in order to estimate the inlet flow rate."
Are there any ouotdoor weather station at CSQ site?,"Yes, the station can measure dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure."
What is CSQ?,CSQ is an abbreviation from Chamchuri Square.
How many risers are there in chamchuri chiller plant?,"There are a total of 5 risers from the main chilled water header. These include header towards office 1 and 2, residence and plaza."
What is AI?,"AI stands for artificial intelligence, and it can be used to assist chiller plant operation and management in order to boost operators' productivity and working efficiency"
Which chillers should I run at building load of 720 TR,"Since there are 700-TR chillers in the plant, we can operate the plant with one single 700-TR centrifugal chiller"
How each equipment in the plant communicates to each other?,"Every device is linked to main gateway located in the control room either by Ethernet or  by RS485 wiring. VSDs can be monitored and controlled through Modbus RTU protocol while non-VSD pumps and cooling towers can be controlled via BACnet protocol. For newly installed chillers, each chiller can be easily accessed with BACnet protocol. Old chillers are still communicating through Trane COMM4 protocol."
