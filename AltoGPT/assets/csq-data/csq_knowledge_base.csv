The SCHP-03 Modbus address 25 cannot be accessed using an agent or scripts. Instead, it can be polled using the Modscan program approximately 10-20 times, with the data appearing only once. On the other hand, the SCHP-09 Modbus address 32 cannot be accessed using an agent or scripts, but can be successfully polled using the Modscan program. The old CPMS is able to monitor and control both of these addresses."

SCHP-09 Modbus Address: 32

The old CPMS is capable of both monitoring and controlling both SCHP-03 and SCHP-09.
To ensure a successful second UAT process, we will proactively address the challenges currently faced in retrieving values for both SCHP-03 and SCHP-09. Once these issues have been resolved, we will thoroughly test both pumps during the second UAT process to ensure their proper functioning.

Project Next steps,Project Next steps,"Next steps
The next steps in the user acceptance testing process for the AltoTech CPMS for the Chamchuri Square building will involve testing the chillers. These chillers have not yet been included in the testing scope, and it is important to ensure that they are functioning correctly before the system is released for use. Also, SCHP03 and SCHP09 are yet to be successfully tested due to communication difficulties between AltoTech CPMS and the hardware. We will seek to find the solution for this problem as well before the next submission and UAT.

To test the chillers, the second round of UAT will be conducted in early January 2023. This round of testing will focus specifically on the chillers and will ensure that they are functioning as expected and meeting the necessary acceptance criteria. By conducting this additional round of testing, we can ensure that the entire system is functioning properly and is ready for use.

","gChamchuri Square building
2nd UAT Completion Report. Since the first UAT, our team has made several updates to the system, including the implementation of new pipes with color-matching to the real ones and the reduction of the size of the 350 TR chiller to be smaller than other, larger units. Additionally, we have implemented the ability to adjust chiller parameters, including on/off set point values.

To ensure the success of the UAT, our team conducted various testing activities, including the use of a BACnet to test the values of the chillers. During these tests, we controlled several parameters, including the Chiller Set Point, On/Off status of the chiller, and the percentage current limit.

This comprehensive document details these testing activities, including any additional details such as data points and controls."
Important issue,Important issue,"Important issue
The issue at hand is the outdated Comm4 protocol, which is no longer supported by Trane. While we can still retrieve data via the legacy CPMS, Niagara, we are faced with a lack of documentation for the old chiller, making it difficult to write code for the interface.

The new chiller with a BACnet IP connector through a switch can enter the 192.168.10.xxx band without any problem.


To address this issue, we have considered the following solutions:

[Probability of success < 40%] We will explore using Wireshark to sniff packets and hack into COMM4 via RS485 to see if it works. If successful, this would enable us to write code for the interface, cutting out the original Niagara and using AltoTech software completely.


[Probability of success < 70% (requires payment fees for Niagara software license)] If Wireshark and hack don't work, our next option is to run both Alto CPMS in parallel with Niagara. The original Niagara will only pull data from the old chillers, while the others will be moved to the Alto CPMS. 

With this option, we need to install MQTT driver and JSON toolkit into the existing Niagara setting in order to enable MQTT communication between existing IoT gateway (running Niagara) and the new IoT gateway (running Alto CPMS).  

To do this, we will need to purchase a JSON toolkit license and run the Niagara MQTT driver. However, before installation, we will need to check if the original MA license for Niagara has expired. If it has, the MA contract must be renewed in order to install the JSON toolkit.


[Probability of success < 50% (require investment on controller hardware, installation, and commissioning fees from Trane)] We will upgrade the old chillers to ensure compatibility with current communication protocols. This includes identifying and implementing the most cost-efficient solution to convert the old chillers to communicate using Modbus or BACnet, in order to resolve ongoing issues. The candidate hardware choices are Trane's SymbioTM Controls and/or Trane’s UC800.


[Probability of success < 100%(NOW DONE)] Finally, if all else fails, we will need to isolate the old chiller altogether and create a new dashboard so that only the old chiller remains in Niagara. This means that operators will need to view two screens in parallel. However, we will try to make the data display in the Alto CPMS as much as possible to minimize the confusion."
