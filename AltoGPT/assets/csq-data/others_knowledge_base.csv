What is Reinforcement Learning,What is Reinforcement Learning,"The idea behind Reinforcement Learning is that an Agent will learn from the Environment by interacting with it through trial and error and receiving Rewards as feedback for its Actions. The agent learns the best action to take in each situation to achieve a bigger cumulative reward. The selection of an action in a particular state is done by a Policy, and the cumulative reward achievable from that state is called the Value function. To behave optimally, the policy must select the action that will bring the highest value."
What is Imitation Learning,What is Imitation Learning,"is an alternative solution to this problem. Instead of trying to learn from sparse rewards or manually specifying a reward function, an expert (e.g. a human) provides the agent with a set of demonstrations. The agent then attempts to learn the optimal policy by imitating the expertâ€™s decisions."
